# Hypothesis Testing Exercises with Python
<!-- endhide -->

In this repo you can find methods of testing out Hypothesis from data you are presented using Python, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas. 
It's key knowledge for any aspiring Data Scientist to test out Hypothesis to understand the data they are presented, but also to understand accuracy of your hypothesis to rule out Null Hypothesis. 

## üìí Key Takes

In this Jupyter Notebook we dive into Seaborn / Matplotlib along SciPy and NumPy to plot and work the data towards testing out or Null Hypothesis. 
It's fundamental to always start by analyzing the data and nothing better then Seaborn / Matplotlib to visualize the data. It makes the process of exploring data much easier to understand but also to explain to others how the data is distributed and what it means, just like we can see below when trying to see if the data matches with our hypothesis üìù

SciPy, especially .stats module is important for Hypothesis testing, as it allows us to run t-tests to get our p-value, which will allow us to Reject or not the Null Hypothesis. 
You don't need to be a Probability / Statistics wizards to understand all this, but it helps have some knowledge and dive in the subject if you haven't experience from beforehand.
